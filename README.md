# Motor RPM Measuring System

This project is a microcontroller-based system designed to measure the real-time RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) of a DC motor. It uses an infrar Hall effect sensor to detect motor rotation and displays the RPM on an LCD screen. This system can be used for educational, industrial, or hobbyist applications where motor speed monitoring is essential.

## Working Principle

1. The potentiometer sets the motor speed by adjusting PWM output to the L298 driver.
2. The encoder generates pulses as the motor shaft rotates.
3. Arduino counts these pulses over a time interval to calculate RPM.
4. The LCD displays the measured RPM in real-time.
